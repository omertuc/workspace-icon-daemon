# Workspace Icon Daemon for sway and i3

![Example i3bar with workspace icons](docs/assets/i3bar-example.png)

Dynamically show running application icons in workspace names and window
titlebars on **Sway and i3**.

The daemon discovers all installed desktop applications, builds a color icon
font, and dynamically updates workspace names and application titles when
windows open, close or move. This approach should work on almost any bar that
has font rendering capabilities. i3bar and waybar are explicitly tested.
Crucially, this does not require image rendering capabilities by the bar, since
a font with the appropriate program icons is created on the fly. To use newly
generated icon fonts, the bar or compositor needs to be restarted once by
logging out and back in again.

*Example: Sway with Waybar - workspace names and window titles dynamically
update as applications open, close, and move.*

## Features

- Put program icons into the workspaces on the bar
- Put program icons into the window titlebars
- Automatically detects and displays the correct icon for any program.
- Automatically detects i3 or Sway, with an explicit override when needed.
- Explicitly supports i3bar and Waybar, however other bars with (pango) font
  rendering support should also work
- Supports program count indicators as sub-/superscripts when multiple
  instances of the same program are running.

## Installation

Workspace Icon Daemon is a single Rust binary with the base font bundled in.
At runtime it needs Fontconfig (`fc-cache`, `fc-match`) and `notify-send` for
desktop notifications. Site favicons for browser windows additionally use the
AT-SPI accessibility bus, which most desktops already run.

On Debian or Ubuntu, install the runtime tools with:

```sh
sudo apt install fontconfig libnotify-bin
```

On Arch Linux:

```sh
sudo pacman -S fontconfig libnotify
```

Install a Rust toolchain (e.g. with [rustup](https://rustup.rs)), then build
and install the daemon:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/David0tt/workspace-icon-daemon
cargo install --path ./workspace-icon-daemon
```

The daemon executable is then available at
`~/.cargo/bin/workspace-icon-daemon`. The configuration examples below use this
path.

## Configuration

Use `WorkspaceIconDaemon` as the bar font.

For i3, edit the i3 config:

```i3config
# Pango markup is required for the default titlebar icons.
font pango:monospace 10

bar {
    font WorkspaceIconDaemon 20
    height 30
}

exec_always --no-startup-id ~/.cargo/bin/workspace-icon-daemon
```

For Sway with Waybar, add the font to `~/.config/waybar/style.css`:

```css
* {
    font-family: WorkspaceIconDaemon, sans-serif;
}
```

Then add this to the Sway config:

```swayconfig
font pango:monospace 18

exec_always ~/.cargo/bin/workspace-icon-daemon
```

Both workspace and titlebar icons are enabled by default. You can deactivate
either with the `--no-workspace-icons` and `--no-titlebar-icons` flags.

The daemon applies a per-window `title_format` such as
`<span font_family='WorkspaceIconDaemon'>ICON</span> %title`. The generated
font is used only for the icon; normal title text continues to use the font
configured in Sway. A normal titlebar must be enabled for the icon to be
visible.

Override compositor detection when necessary:

```sh
~/.cargo/bin/workspace-icon-daemon --compositor sway
~/.cargo/bin/workspace-icon-daemon --compositor i3
```

### First start and newly installed applications

On the first start, the daemon scans all XDG desktop entries, builds and
installs the font, sends a desktop notification, and exits without renaming
anything. Log out and back in once; the second start enters the normal
monitoring loop.

When an application not present in the session's loaded font is discovered
(e.g. after installing a new program), the daemon installs an updated font for
the next login and sends a notification. It continues running and displays the
reserved placeholder glyph for that application in the current session.

On either window manager, use workspace **numbers** for switching and moving
windows, because names change dynamically:

```text
bindsym $mod+1 workspace number 1
bindsym $mod+2 workspace number 2
bindsym $mod+Shift+1 move container to workspace number 1
bindsym $mod+Shift+2 move container to workspace number 2
# Repeat for your remaining numbered workspaces.
```

## Options

The most important options you might want to use. Use `--help` for a full list.

```bash
workspace-icon-daemon --help                               # Show all options
workspace-icon-daemon --no-titlebar-icons                  # Don't put icons into the titlebars
workspace-icon-daemon --no-workspace-icons                 # Don't put icons into the workspaces
workspace-icon-daemon --unique-icons                       # Display mode: nonunique | unique | numbers_subscript | numbers_superscript
workspace-icon-daemon --no-placeholder-icon                # Don't use placeholder icons when program icons are not found
workspace-icon-daemon --compositor {auto,i3,sway}          # Explicitly specify the compositor
workspace-icon-daemon --reset                              # stop daemon, restore workspace and title names, remove state, and exit
workspace-icon-daemon --reset-and-rebuild                  # reset, prebuild/install the font, and exit
workspace-icon-daemon --verbose                            # Enable debug output
```

The persistent paths are:

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/workspace-icon-daemon/program_icon_map.yaml`
- `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/workspace-icon-daemon/WorkspaceIconDaemon.ttf`
- `$XDG_DATA_HOME/fonts/WorkspaceIconDaemon.ttf`
- `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/workspace-icon-daemon/daemon.pid`
- `$XDG_DATA_HOME/workspace-icon-daemon/placeholder_icon.svg`

The usual XDG defaults apply when those environment variables are unset.

## Development

```sh
cargo test
cargo run -- --verbose
```

## Limitations

- Newly installed application icons require a logout/login before they replace
  the placeholder glyph.
- Numbers indicating program counts use subscripts/superscripts, which disrupt
  equal spacing between icons. A better solution might use Unicode diacritics
  or embed numbers directly in icons, but this has not been implemented yet.
- This system is relatively hacky. If you want something simpler, you can use
  the default approach of mapping programs to nerdfont symbols used by many
  other setups.

## How It Works

Since most bars cannot display images directly, this daemon creates a custom
font from program icons on-the-fly:

1. At startup, the daemon discovers all installed programs and their icons.
   1. It first scans desktop entries in XDG precedence order:
      1. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications`
      2. Each directory in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, normally:
         - `/usr/local/share/applications`
         - `/usr/share/applications`
      3. `/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications`
   2. For each `.desktop` file, the daemon extracts the `Icon=`
      and `StartupWMClass=` values.
   3. Icons are discovered with the following precedence:
      1. An absolute SVG or PNG path specified directly by `Icon=`.
      2. SVG application icons. The daemon searches `$XDG_DATA_HOME` first,
         followed by each directory in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`. Within each data
         directory it checks, in order:
         1. `icons/hicolor/scalable/apps`
         2. `icons/Humanity/apps` application-icon directories
         3. `icons/HighContrast/scalable/apps`
         4. `pixmaps`
      3. PNG application icons, using the same XDG data-directory precedence.
         Within each data directory it checks:
         1. `icons/hicolor` application-icon directories, starting at 128×128,
            then larger sources, followed by progressively smaller fallbacks.
            The target font uses a 109×109 pixel strike, so nearby resolutions
            are preferred to avoid upscaling.
         2. `pixmaps`
      4. Recursive SVG fallback search through:
         1. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/icons`
         2. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/pixmaps`
         3. The corresponding `icons` and `pixmaps` directories under
            `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`
      5. Recursive PNG fallback search through the same directories.
      6. Note: The explicit application-icon directories are searched before
         recursive theme fallbacks. This prevents symbolic or monochrome theme
         icons from overriding full-color application icons in hicolor. Within
         each format/search tier, user-installed icons under `$XDG_DATA_HOME`
         take precedence over identically named icons in system data
         directories.
2. It reserves `U+E000` for the placeholder icon and assigns stable PUA
   (Private Use Area) Unicode code points to discovered applications.
3. The first run builds the custom icon font, atomically installs it, refreshes
   fontconfig, notifies, and exits. No workspace or titlebar names are changed,
   since hot-swapping the loaded fonts for running applications (compositor,
   bar) is not possible and a restart (logout/login) is required.
4. Later runs use the installed and loaded icon font and dynamically modify
   workspace names and titlebar names to show these icons, based on window
   events.
5. A newly discovered program (e.g. after a new installation) triggers a
   next-session font build and notification; in the current session the
   placeholder icon is used.

## Using the font builder standalone

The font builder is also installed as a standalone tool to create an icon
font from PNG and SVG files:

```sh
icon-font-builder --help
```

The base font must be a bitmap color font containing CBDT and CBLC tables. A
suitable `NotoColorEmoji.ttf` is bundled and used by default; `--base-font`
selects another. Font generation is generally very tricky, and I can not
guarantee it working with other fonts.

### Building a font

You can either put the desired PNG and SVG files into a directory, or build from
an explicit list, using either the `--input-folder` or `--icon-paths` flag.
Example

```sh
icon-font-builder \
    --icon-paths /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/firefox.svg /usr/share/icons/breeze/apps/16/utilities-terminal.svg \
    --output ./MyIconFont.ttf \
    --family-name MyIconFont \
    --pua-start 0xE100 \
    --remove-original-symbols
```

PNG images are resized to the base font's bitmap strike size when necessary
(for NotoColorEmoji this is 109x109); SVG images are rasterized at that size.
`--remove-original-symbols` removes the base font's existing emoji glyphs and
produces an icon-only font. Omit it if you want to retain the original glyphs as
well.

You can use `font-manager MyIconFont.ttf` to inspect the generated font and you
can use `fc-cache` to install it. If this does not work, you might want to use
the font-viewer directly: `/usr/lib/font-manager/font-viewer MyIconFont.ttf`.

### Possible Future Features

- [ ] Limit maximum number of icons shown per workspace
- [ ] Better icon spacing when using count indicators
- [ ] support for different bars. In theory, this works, with any bar that shows
      workspaces by their title, and where you can set the font (and that has a
      reasonable font rendering support, e.g. for emojis). However, the updating
      sequence needs to be modified, depending on the bar.
- [ ] In general, sway is tested much better than i3, since it is my daily
      driver. If you come across any bugs on i3, please open an issue.
- [ ] The unicode PUA (private use area) used contains 6,399 code points, so if
      you have more than this amount of applications on your system installed,
      this could be an issue.

- Changing the application titles to show program icons in titlebars is inspired
  by [1](https://gist.github.com/dmelliot/437924ff581f3f1edd59f44833be6cc6),
  [2](https://github.com/iguanajuice/sway-font-awesome), and
  [3](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/4882#issuecomment-611464474).

Unlike these projects, which rely on pre-existing icon fonts (like FontAwesome
or Nerd Fonts) with predefined program-to-icon mappings, my daemon uses actual
program icons from your system. Therefore in contrast to these other tools it
can:

1. Show color icons.
2. Show icons for almost any program automatically.

If you encounter a program where no icon or the wrong icon is shown, please let
me know in an issue.
